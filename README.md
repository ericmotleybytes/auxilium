Auxilium
========

Shell utilities for paths, sourcing, aliasing, GUIDs, and unit test summaries

Introduction
============

*Auxilium* is the latin word for *support*. The "auxilium" package is an open-source project which contains a collection of bash shell executable and sourceable scripts which support, and make easier, many common Unix/Linux user tasks. All auxilium utilities are written in \*bash", the standard Linux interpretive shell language. This facilitates portability (between bash platforms) and ease of installation. Auxilium has no runtime prerequisites other than bash version 4.2 or higher.

The core auxilium utilities include:

-   **auxenv**. Setup, manipulation, and optimization of path-like environment variables such as *PATH*, *MANPATH*, and *LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH*.

-   **auxwhere**. Find files by filename search through path-like environment variable directories.

-   **auxsource**. An extended version of the bash built-in *source* command.

-   **auxalias**. Creates static or dynamic aliases for all auxilium sourceable scripts.

-   **auxchecktap**. Scans and checks TAP format unit test result logs, producing a summarized TAP test results log.

-   **auxguid**. Generates a pseudo random 128-bit (32 hex character) GUID/UUID.
