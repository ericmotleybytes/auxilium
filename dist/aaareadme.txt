This "dist" directory is a holding directory to support generation of
runtime-only distribution tar files. Most of the files in this directory
are (or will be) dynamically generated by Makefile as preparation
for a new GitHub release.

When creating a relase with GitHub, GitHub automatically creates a source
distribution tar file which includes only items in the git source code
repository tagged with the corresponding release version tag. However,
to install auxilium from source requires some special tools, such as "Bats"
for unit testing, "pandoc" for document generation, etc. Many users just
want to use the synamically generated run-time files and would prefer to
not have to install additional development tools.

To support the run-time-only end-user, auxilium generates a special run-time
only distribution tar file which is easier to install and does not require
building from sources. This tar file has the corresponding release version
number in the filename. This tar file is generally not placed under git
source code control (it can be dynamically regenerated). However, the file
is uploaded as a "binary attachment" to the GitHub release. Users looking
to download auxilium from a GitHub release can then choose between downloading
the source distribution or the run-time distribution.
