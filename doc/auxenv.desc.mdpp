**auxenv** - Solves many problems working with path-like environment
variables such as PATH, MANPATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and so forth. It can
display current settings in an easy to read form. It can
add, delete, and reorder directory positions, it can weed out duplicate
or nonexistent directories, and much more. The power of auxenv allows
system administrators and end-users to create more robust and flexible
login initialization scripts. Auxenv is also very useful to anyone who
needs to switch back and forth between different versions of a
programming language, enhancing or replacing the Linux "scl" utility.
