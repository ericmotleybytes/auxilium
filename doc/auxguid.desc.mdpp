**auxguid** - Generates a 32 hexidecimal character representation of
a 128 bit randomly generated GUID (Globally Unique IDentifier) using
only bash. These are also sometimes called UUID's (Universally Unique
IDentifiers). By default, an auxilium specific algorithm is used to
generate the GUID using bash random, timestamp to nanoseconds, process
id, etc. The odds of an accidental duplicate GUID collision are
astronomically low. Optionally, if it is installed on the system,
auxguid can use the Linux "uuidgen" utility.
