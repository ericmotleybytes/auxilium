*auxwhere* is an executable bash script which can find a file by filename
searching across directories in path-like environment variables. By default,
the PATH variable is used, but other environment variables can also be specified.
Permutations of sub-directories and file types can also be specified.
By default, only the file specification of the first match is output, but
if optionally requested, then all matches can be output, one file specification per line.
If no matching files are found, then nothing is output.
