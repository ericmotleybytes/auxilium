*Auxilium* is the latin word for *support*. The "auxilium" package is an open-source
project which contains a collection of bash shell executable and sourceable scripts which
support, and make easier, many common Unix/Linux user tasks. All auxilium utilities are
written in *bash", the standard Linux interpretive shell language. This facilitates
portability (between bash platforms) and ease of installation. Auxilium has no runtime
prerequisites other than bash version 4.2 or higher.

The core auxilium utilities include:

* **auxenv**.
!include(auxenv-short.md)
* **auxwhere**.
!include(auxwhere-short.md)
* **auxsource**.
!include(auxsource-short.md)
* **auxalias**.
!include(auxalias-short.md)
* **auxchecktap**.
!include(auxchecktap-short.md)
* **auxguid**.
!include(auxguid-short.md)
* **auxilium**.
!include(auxilium-short.md)
