*Auxilium* is the latin word for *support". The "auxilium" package is an open-source
project which contains a collection of bash shell executable and sourceable scripts which
support, and make easier, many common Unix/Linux user tasks. All auxilium utilities are
written in *bash", the standard Linux interpretive shell language. This facilitates
portability (between bash platforms) and ease of installation. Auxilium has no run-time
prerequisites other than bash version 4.2 or higher.

The core auxilium utilities include:

* **auxenv**.
!include(auxenv-introduction.md)
* **auxwhere**.
!include(auxwhere-introduction.md)
* **auxsource**.
!include(auxsource-introduction.md)
* **auxalias**.
!include(auxalias-introduction.md)
* **auxchecktap**.
!include(auxguid-introduction.md)
* **auxguid**.
!include(auxguid-introduction.md)
