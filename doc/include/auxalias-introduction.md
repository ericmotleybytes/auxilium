A sourceable script.
Facilitates creation of *aliases* for all auxilium sourceable scripts, which makes it
possible to invoke a sourceable script like a command. It can create "static" aliases
hard coded to a particular directory or "dynamic" aliases which dynamically use a
path-like environment variable to find the right location of a sourcable script (much
like how executable programs are located through PATH).
