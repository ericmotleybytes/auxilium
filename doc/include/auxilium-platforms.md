Auxilium programs are all written in [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)),
the standard [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) shell language. Bash is an
interpretive language, so as long as your platform has a relatively new version of Bash
installed, it *should* be able to run the runtime Auxilium Bash scripts. There is no need of
different runtime versions of Auxilium for different hardware platforms because there
are no hard-compiled programs.

That being said, to date Auxilium has only been tested on Linux platforms. The author,
however, would be very interested in user experience reports.
