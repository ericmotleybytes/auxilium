An executable script.
Helps find files by filename when you are not sure of the directory by
searching though a list in a path-like environment variable. The auxwhere utility
is similar to, but also different than, other non-auxilium utilities such as *which*
and *whereis*. The auxwhere utility is very flexible and can be used for many purposes,
but it is geared towards making it easier to use sourceable (but non-executable) scripts
in a manner closer to executable scripts.
