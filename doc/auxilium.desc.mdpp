Auxilium provides a set of bash utility scripts which help solve some common
problems such as:

* Viewing and manipulating settings of list environment variables like PATH.
* Checking and managing TAP-compliant unit test results.
* Being able to generate a GUID/UUID without an additional programming language.
* Controlling bash "source" file selection with a path-like environment variable.
