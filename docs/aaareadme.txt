From the master/original auxilium GitHub repository at
https://github.com/ericmotleybytes/auxilium , this
"docs" directory is linked to a GitHub Pages mini-website
at https://github.com/ericmotleybytes/auxilium/settings .
Any files in this directory that are also in the git
repository automatically get pushed to the mini-website
when they are git committed and pushed into the repository
(on the master branch). The git-repository to mini-website
sync can take 30 to 60 seconds however.
