This is the auxilium "test" directory. It supports automated unit testing of
auxilium scripts and programs.

The "Bats" (Bash Automated Testing System) available from
https://github.com/sstephenson/bats and is the primary unit test system used
by auxilium.

Files in this directory include:

  ./aaareadme.txt
    This file.

  ./*.bats
    These are the unit test scripts for Bats. These unit tests assume that they
    are in a subdirectory called "test" and that the scripts and programs to be
    tested are in the "test/../bin" subdirectory.

  ./test_helper.bash
    This file is sourced by many of the .bat test scripts and contains
    bash functions definitions for unit test setup and teardown instructions.
    Importantly, this setup helps assure that the unit tests always run
    the scripts and programs being tested from the correct directory.

  ./fake
    This is a subdirectory which includes static simulated data files which
    are used by various unit test scripts.

  ./auxilium.taplog
    This is a saved TAP format unit test results log file. It is generally
    created by ../Makefile which invokes "bats -t" on all *.bats files in
    this test directory. The ../Makefile script will only rerun the unit
    tests to recreate this file if any auxilium "../bin" script changes,
    if any "./*.bats" file changes or is added, or if "./auxilium.taplog"
    is deleted.
    See https://testanything.org/ for information about TAP formatted unit test
    results files.

  ./auxilium.tapchk
    This is a TAP format file created by running ../bin/auxchacktap on the
    ./auxilium.taplog file. It is essentially a test summary of a test summary.
    It is generally generated by ..Makefile and is only regenerated if
    the ./auxilium.taplog file changes.

  ./setup_interactive.bash
    This is a sourceable bash script designed to setup a users interactive
    aliases and environment variables to use the ../bin and ../share/man
    directories that these unit tests test. This script is NOT executed by
    the automated unit tests (they set things up elsewhere). The script is
    included for interactive convenience only.

  ./teardown_interactive.bash
    This is a sourceable bash script which tries to undo (or teardown) the
    changes which ./setup_interactive.bash made to aliases and environment
    variables. Amongst other thing, this script reruns /etrc/bashrc, ~/.bashrc,
    and ~/.bash_profile. This normally restores things to a sensible default,
    but it is not fail proof.
